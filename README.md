# POS_Tagging

This is a project realized in the framework of the course of Computational Linguistics. The aim of the project is "Part of Speech Tagging" where  part-of-speech 
tagging (POS tagging or PoS tagging or POST), also called grammatical tagging is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular 
part of speech, based on both its definition and its context.
